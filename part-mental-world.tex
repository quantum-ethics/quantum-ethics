\section{The mind-body problem}

Since the end of the second World War and the translation of the intellectual center of the scientific community from Europe to the United States of America, materialism, i.e. the complete reduction of our experience of mind to purely material processes, has become the philosophical conviction of mainstream physicists, although they still may have opposite religious beliefs as private persons. Of course, it doesn't make any doubt that the biological activity of human and similar animal brains is involved in the processing of external and internal stimuli, and it is reasonable to believe that, at the material level, conscious thinking is the emerging result of an intensive and highly parallelized information processing activity by the brain's neural network. Nevertheless, ``mind'', i.e. the form of our experience of the world, with our feelings, our body schema, memories seen with the mind's eye, melodies imagined in the mind's ear... is just not \textit{the same} as the neural activity of an individual body (which is anyhow hardly identifiable quantum physically). Determining the relation between these two realities is the essence of the mind-body problem, which has become the most various answers over the ages. The usual divergence points arise about the questions: Do both realities exist at all, or is one of them a mere illusion? Are they independent of each other and just exist as parallel realities, or are there divergences and a mutual influence in the one, the other or both directions? In this old debate, Quantum Field Theory introduces the new idea that a mutual influence doesn't have to be a deterministic causal influence but also could be a probabilistic one, so that neither ``mind'' nor ``body'' have to be kind of a subordinated slave of its counterpart, but retain to some extent a form of ``freedom'' under its influence. I think this idea should have the potential to take some heat out of the debate.

\section{Individual mind}

Each of us has a direct experience of the reality of an individual mind, so I will only expose a few reflections in this place. I think that the state of an individual mind should be considered in its ``organic'' unity, that picking out single conscious thoughts and considering that the state of this mind is simply composed of these should be considered as an oversimplified and inadequate view. Within this ``organic'' unity, however, the intensity of consciousness may vary, focusing our awareness on some aspects rather than on others. The border between conscious and unconscious thoughts is therefore not really clear to ourselves, as there is a slow transition made up of more or less subconscious thoughts of decreasing intensity. When I refer to the state of an individual mind, I will mean in principle the unity of all conscious and subconscious thoughts, although we're not quite sure of where they end. They will, in general, contain among other things representations of a body, of its activity, of its environment, of past experiences... as well as representations of time, which make up our feeling of being continuously ourselves in the continuity of time. But I believe that this feeling of permanence of the individual mind is a mere illusion, for two reasons: First, this feeling is experienced in every single instant of consciousness; we could by no mean find out if we really have experienced other instants of consciousness ``before'' and if these instants of consciousness correspond to our current memories or not, so this feeling of permanence \textit{could} be an illusion. In fact, if I would suddenly experience another individual mind (with its own memories and not mine), I wouldn't even notice it! Second, the experience of an individual mind seems to cease as ``our'' body is dreamless sleeping, swoon or eventually die, so I think its permanence is discarded by common experience. Therefore, I don't believe that an individual mind is a fundamental entity of the mental world, which would have an existence of its own and evolve in time, and I will only refer to instantaneous \textit{states} of an individual mind, which are not related to each other across time in the form of a personal history at a fundamental level.

\section{Collective mind}

The states of the mental world are supposed to be experienced collectively by the set of all ``sentient beings''. A state $\cms$ of the mental world can also be described by the number $\bM N \ims$ of ``sentient beings'' experiencing each possible individual mind state $\ims$. An arbitrary sequence $\bFM N \ims$, however, doesn't necessarily correspond to a possible collective mind state $\cms$. In fact, as a consequence of the correspondence between mental and quantum states defined subsequently and of the finite dimensionality of the Hilbert space of the quantum states, there must be a finite number of possible collective and individual mind states. The set of all possible collective mind states is written $\CMS$.

\section{Physical realization of mental states}

The correspondence between mental and quantum states is given by a Hilbert subspace $\H_\cms$ associated to each possible mental state $\cms$ in such a way that these subspaces verify:
\begin{equation*}
\H = \bigoplus_{\cms}^\perp \H_\cms
\end{equation*}
Each vector $\ket \Psi \in \H_\cms$ is a quantum state of the universe in which the mental state $\cms$ is being experienced. Knowing the correspondence between $\cms$ and $\H_\cms$ is in essence solving the mind-body problem. As a working hypothesis, I shall assume that a mental state $\cms = \bFM N \ims$ is being realized physically by any quantum state describing a universe containing, for each individual mind state $\ims$, exactly $\bM N \ims$ human or animal brains presenting the specific activity pattern corresponding to $\ims$. The task of describing the possible individual mind states belongs in principle to psychology, whereas the characterization of the corresponding activity patterns of the brain is the aim of cognitive neuroscience.

In mathematical terms, this hypothesis can be modeled as follows. First, the mental state $\cms_\vac \eqdef \bFM 0 \ims$, in which no ``sentient being'' is experiencing any individual mind state, is supposed to be possible, i.e. the corresponding subspace $\H_{\cms_\vac}$ is supposed not to be null. Then, for each possible individual mind state $\ims$, there is supposed to be a finite family of brain creation operators $(\dop{\Psi_\ims^\alpha})$ in $\cAlg$, which are creating a single brain with an activity pattern corresponding to $\ims$, such as:
\begin{equation*}
\H_{\bM 1 \ims} = \bigoplus_{\alpha}^\perp \dop{\Psi_\ims^\alpha} \H_{\cms_\vac}
\end{equation*}
Finally, for every collective mental state $\cms$, noting $\cms + \bM 1 \ims$ the collective mental state in which a single further ``sentient being'' is experiencing the individual mental state $\ims$, the corresponding subspaces are supposed to verify:
\begin{equation*}
\H_{\cms + \bM 1 \ims} = \sum_{\alpha} \dop{\Psi_\ims^\alpha} \H_{\cms}
\end{equation*}
These relations define all the subspaces $\H_{\cms}$ recursively as a function of $\H_{\cms_\vac}$ and of the operators $\dop{\Psi_\ims^\alpha}$. If a subspace defined in this way happens to be null (because of the existence of a maximum occupation number for single field modes), the corresponding mental state is impossible.

Given two collective mental states $\cms = \bFM N \ims$ and $\cms' = \bFM {N'} \ims$, we define the partial order relation $\cms' \geq \cms$ by $\forall \ims, \bM {N'} \ims \geq \bM N \ims$. The subspace $\H_{\cms}^+$ of the quantum states corresponding to collective mental states where at least $\bM N \ims$ ``sentient beings'' are experiencing each individual mental state $\ims$ can be defined, with this notation, by:
\begin{equation*}
\H_{\cms}^+ \eqdef \bigoplus_{\cms' \geq \cms}^\perp \H_{\cms'}
\end{equation*}

\paragraphtitle{Commentaries} The different brain creation operators $\dop{\Psi_\ims^\alpha}$ corresponding to the same individual mind state $\ims$ may differ for instance by a translation or a rotation of the brain, by any modification of its physical environment which doesn't involve the creation of a second brain, or by any internal modification of the quantum state of the brain itself, insofar as this doesn't influence the associated conscious thoughts. We could think for instance of neurophysiological processes involved in the unconscious brain activity or of irrelevant low-level biochemical processes.

\label{Stochastic evolution}

\section{Collapse and collective mind selection}

In the joint evolution of the mental and quantum states of the universe, I suppose that the quantum state $\ket \Psi$ periodically becomes randomly projected into one of the subspaces $\H_\cms$, corresponding to a given mental state $\cms$, with a probability given by:
\begin{equation*}
P(\cms) = \frac{\bra\Psi \op{\Pi}_\cms \ket\Psi}{\braket\Psi\Psi}
\end{equation*}
where $\op{\Pi}_\cms$ is the orthogonal projection operator on $\H_\cms$. Furthermore, I suppose that this projection corresponds to the fact that, in the mental world, the collective mind state $\cms = \bFM N \ims$ is being experienced, i.e. each possible individual mind state $\ims$ is being experienced by $\bM N \ims$ individual minds. We call the material part of this process ``collapse'' of the quantum state of the universe and its mental counterpart ``collective mind selection''. The operators $\op{\Pi}_\cms$ are called ``collapse operators''. As a working hypothesis, we assume that the period $\tau$ of this process is of the order of the Plank time:
\begin{equation*}
\tau \approx \sqrt{4\pi\G \h/\c^5}\approx4.8~10^{-43}\ \mathrm s
\end{equation*}

\section{Mental evolution}

Fundamentally, Quantum Field Theory also defines the probability that any given succession of collective mind states be experienced, an initial quantum state being given. In the case where the actually experienced collective mind state has a relatively high probability, our mental state may give us some clues about the physics of the world we live in; on the opposite, if our collective mind state has a very low probability, our mental experience has very little to do with the laws of the physical world and we live in a mere illusion of knowing something about the material reality -- without having any mean of noticing it. This dilemma is very well known of particle physicists, who have to accept they cannot make more precise statements about reality than, for instance, ``in the context of the standard model and in the presence of a sequential fourth family of fermions with high masses [...] a Higgs boson with mass between 144 and 207 GeV/$\mathrm{c}^2$ is ruled out at 95\% confidence level''~\cite{CMS2011}. Any physical model can also be conventionally, but not definitely, ``ruled out'' if it predicts the observed results with a probability considered to be too low.

Given an initial quantum state $\ket{\Psi_0} \in \H_{\cms_0}$ at $t = 0$, the probability $P(\cms_t,t)$ that a given collective mind state $\cms_t$ is being realized at time $t \tau$, where $t \in \IN^*$, reads for $t = 1$:
\begin{equation*}
P(\cms_1,1) = \bra{\Psi_0} \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \op U_\tau \ket{\Psi_0} / \braket{\Psi_0}{\Psi_0}
\end{equation*}
where $\op U_\tau \eqdef \exp{- \i 2 \pi \Hop \tau / \h}$, and more generally for $t \geq 2$:
\begin{equation*}
P(\cms_t,t) = \sum_{\cms_{t - 1}} \dotsm \sum_{\cms_1} \bra{\Psi_0} \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \dotsm \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_t} \op U_\tau \dotsm \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \op U_\tau \ket{\Psi_0} / \braket{\Psi_0}{\Psi_0}
\end{equation*}
If the initial vector state isn't exactly known, averaging on an orthonormal basis of $\H_{\cms_0}$ leads to:
\begin{equation*}
\left< P(\cms_t,t) \right>_{\cms_0} = \sum_{\cms_{t - 1}} \dotsm \sum_{\cms_1} \mathrm{Tr}_{\H_{\cms_0}} \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \dotsm \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_t} \op U_\tau \dotsm \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \op U_\tau / \mathrm{dim} \H_{\cms_0}
\end{equation*}

\section{Transition probability}

We consider, to simplify the discussion, a repeated experiment with a single possible outcome, which may have been realized or not after a given duration $t \tau$. Notice that this duration doesn't correspond to the instant at which some physical event occurs, but is a sufficiently long duration after which the experimenter can consciously remember of having (just) observed the expected outcome or not.

The possible states of the minds corresponding to the beginning of the experiment are written $\cms_i$ and the initial state of the quantum fields is also an element of the Hilbert subspace $\H_i$ given by:
\begin{equation*}
\H_i = \bigoplus_{\cms_i}^\perp \H_{\cms_i}
\end{equation*}
The possible states of the minds corresponding to the measurement of the given outcome resp. of its absence are written $\cms_f^+$ resp. $\cms_f^-$. If the experiment works correctly, the final state of the quantum fields is, after measurement, an element of either of the Hilbert subspaces $\H_f^+$ or $\H_f^-$ given by:
\begin{equation*}
\H_f^\pm = \bigoplus_{\cms_f^\pm}^\perp \H_{\cms_f^\pm}
\end{equation*}
If the experiment fails for some reason (e.g. if some measuring device is getting damaged during the experiment), the final state of the quantum fields is orthogonal to $\H_f^+ \oplus \H_f^-$.

The absolute probability of measuring the given outcome resp. its absence is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\TP{\H_i}{\H_f^\pm} = \sum_{\cms_{t - 1}} \dotsm \sum_{\cms_1} \mathrm{Tr}_{\H_i} \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \dotsm \dop U_\tau \op \Pi_{f^\pm} \op U_\tau \dotsm \op \Pi_{\cms_1} \op U_\tau / \mathrm{dim} \H_i
\end{equation*}
where $\op \Pi_{f^\pm} = \sum_{\cms_f^\pm} \op \Pi_{\cms_f^\pm}$. The conditional probability of measuring the given outcome if the experiment doesn't fail is then given by:
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal T \TP{\H_i}{\H_f^+} = \frac{\TP{\H_i}{\H_f^+}}{\TP{\H_i}{\H_f^+} + \TP{\H_i}{\H_f^-}}
\end{equation*}
and we call it ``transition probability'' from $\H_i$ to $\H_f^+$.

If the experiment is conceived in such a way that the studied system is isolated from the observer for the duration of the experiment until it interacts with some measurement apparatus, the experiment is considered to have failed if the observer has gained some information about the studied system before it interacts with this apparatus. An intermediate observation of the system, as it would leave a permanent trace in the memory of the observer, would lead with a vanishingly small probability to a final state of the minds in which the observer isn't conscious of having made this observation. The only intermediate states of the minds $\cms_1, \dotsc, \cms_{t - 1}$ to be considered in the above sums (i.e. which haven't a vanishingly small contribution to the transition probability) correspond also to projectors that don't affect the Hamiltonian evolution of the studied system. In that case, the absolute probability of measuring the given outcome resp. its absence can be approximated by:
\begin{equation*}
\TP{\H_i}{\H_f^\pm} \approx \mathrm{Tr}_{\H_i} \dop U_{t \tau} \op \Pi_{f^\pm} \op U_{t \tau} / \mathrm{dim} \H_i
\end{equation*}
and can be written as a sum resp. a mean on quantum states forming an orthonormal basis of $\H_f^\pm$ resp. $\H_i$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TP{\H_i}{\H_f^\pm} & \approx & \sum_f \left< \TP i f \right>_i \\
\TP i f & \eqdef & \left| \Um f i {t \tau}{0} \right|^2
\end{eqnarray*}
In this expression, the (absolute) transition probabilities $\TP i f$ between two quantum states can be developed in series of the form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TP i f & = & \sum_{n=0}^\infty \TPn i f n \\
\TPn i f n & \eqdef & \sum_{n_1 + n_2 = n} \cc{\Umn f i {n_1} {t \tau}{0}} \Umn f i {n_2} {t \tau}{0}
\end{eqnarray*}
If $i$ and $f$ are plane wave states, these terms can be written using the scattering matrix as:
\begin{equation*}
\TPn i f n \eqdef \sum_{n_1 + n_2 = n} \cc{\Smn f i {n_1}} \Smn f i {n_2}
\end{equation*}

\section{Leading order transition probability}

The general form of the transition probability between plane wave modes of the field can be given without knowing much about the interaction term $\Hop'$. We assume here that the initial and final states of the field are plane waves of the form:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ket{\Psi_i} & = & \ket{\bFQ {N_i} \pt \q \sp} \\
\ket{\Psi_f} & = & \ket{\bFQ {N_f} \pt \q \sp}
\end{eqnarray*}
The first interesting terms in the development of the transition probability are given in that case by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TPn i f 0 & \eqdef & \cc{\Smn f i 0} \Smn f i 0 = \delta_{f,i} \\
\TPn i f 1 & \eqdef & \cc{\Smn f i 0} \Smn f i 1 + \cc{\Smn f i 1} \Smn f i 0 = 0
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TPn i f 2 & \eqdef & \cc{\Smn f i 0} \Smn f i 2 + \cc{\Smn f i 1} \Smn f i 1 + \cc{\Smn f i 2} \Smn f i 0 \\
& = & ( 2 \pi )^2 \frac{t - t_0} \h \left| H'_{f,i} \right|^2 \deltaE2{E_f - E_i} \\
&& -\delta_{f,i} ( 2 \pi )^2 \frac{t - t_0} \h \sum_{\bFQ {N_1} \pt \q \sp} \left| H'_{1,i} \right|^2 \deltaE2{E_1 - E_i}
\end{eqnarray*}
where the nascent delta function $\deltaE2{E}$ is defined as in appendix \ref{delta}.

\section{Higher order transition probability}

To the order $n \geq 2$, the transition probability between plane wave states $\ket{\bFQ {N_i} \pt \q \sp}$ and $\ket{\bFQ {N_f} \pt \q \sp}$ is given by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TPn i f n & \eqdef & \sum_{n_1 + n_2 = n} \cc{\Smn f i {n_1}} \Smn f i {n_2} \\
& = & \delta_{f,i} \sideset{}{_{k=1}^{n-1}}\sum_{\bFQ {N_k} \pt \q \sp} \left( \Smp n {i,\dotsc,i} + \cc{\Smp n {i,\dotsc,i}} \right) \\
&& + \sum_{\substack{n_1 + n_2 = n \\ n_1, n_2 \geq 1}} \cc{\Smn f i {n_1}} \Smn f i {n_2}
\end{eqnarray*}
The first term vanishes for $f \neq i$. The development of the last term involves a ``closed loop'' of length $n$ from $i$ to $i$ over $f$, i.e. a summation over $n - 2$ intermediate states $\ket{\bFQ {N_k} \pt \q \sp}$, where $k \in \IntRange{-n_1}{n_2}$, $\bFQ {N_0} \pt \q \sp = \bFQ {N_i} \pt \q \sp$ and $\bFQ {N_{-n_1}} \pt \q \sp = \bFQ {N_{n_2}} \pt \q \sp = \bFQ {N_f} \pt \q \sp$, and can be written as:
\begin{multline*}
\sum_{\substack{n_1 + n_2 = n \\ n_1, n_2 \geq 1}} \sideset{}{_{k=-n_1}^{n_2}}\sum_{\bFQ {N_k} \pt \q \sp} \left( \prod_{k = -n_1}^{n_2 - 1} H'_{k+1,k} \right) \cc{\SmE{n_1}{E_{-n_1}, \dotsc, E_0}} \SmE{n_2}{E_{n_2}, \dotsc, E_0}
\end{multline*}

To the third order, for instance, the transition probability for $f \neq i$ reads:
\begin{multline*}
\TPn i f 3 = ( 2 \pi )^3 \deltaE1{E_f - E_i} \\
\sum_{\bFQ {N_1} \pt \q \sp} \left[ \Im \left( H'_{i,f} H'_{f,1} H'_{1,i} \right ) \deltaE1{E_f - E_1} \deltaE1{E_1 - E_i} \right. \\
\left. + \Re \left( H'_{i,f} H'_{f,1} H'_{1,i} \right ) \frac{\deltaE1{E_f - E_i} - \cos{\pi \frac{t - t_0} \h ( E_f - E_1 )} \deltaE1{E_1 - E_i}}{\pi ( E_f - E_1 )} \right]
\end{multline*}
where the nascent delta function $\deltaE1{E}$ is defined as in appendix \ref{delta}.

\section{Ideal experimental setup}

We consider a scattering experiment designed to produce $n_f$ particles of type $\pt_j$, of wave vector $\q_j$ and of spin state $\sp_j$. To detect them all, a set of $n_f$ particle detectors $D_j$ is being used and we consider a single alternative: either all the detectors are activated or at least one of them isn't. The momentum of the detected particles is measured with an uncertainty given by the domain $\delta P_j$ of the momentum space in which particle $j$ could be found without changing the measurement result. The corresponding subset $\delta Q_j$ of values of $\q_j$ is given in the lattice reference frame by:
\begin{equation*}
\delta Q_j = \FLD \cap \frac \a \h \delta P_j
\end{equation*}
We assume that the corresponding subspace $\delta \F$ of $\H$ is given by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta \F & = & \bigoplus_{(\delta \q_j)}^{\perp} \IC \dop{\Psi}_{f + (\delta \q_j)} \ket{O} \\
\dop{\Psi}_{f + (\delta \q_j)} & \eqdef & \prod_j \cop {\pt_j} {\q_j + \delta \q_j} {\sp_j}
\end{eqnarray*}
where the summation goes over all the $\delta \q_j$ verifying $\q_j + \delta \q_j \in \delta Q_j$ and where $\ket{O}$ describes the experimental setup, including measuring devices and the observer.

The probability that all the detectors are activated is then given by:
\begin{equation*}
\TP i {\delta \F} \eqdef \sum_{(\delta \q_j)} \TP i {f + (\delta \q_j)}
\end{equation*}
If the transition probability $\TP i {f + (\delta \q_j)}$, as a function of $(\delta \q_j)$, admits a continuation on $\IR^{3 n_f}$, an approximation of this sum can be obtained by taking the corresponding integral:
\begin{equation*}
\TP i {\delta \F} \approx \int_{\prod_j \delta P_j} \TP i {f + (\delta \q_j)} \left( (1 + 2 \N) \frac \a \h \right)^{3 n_f} \dtp_1 \dotsm \dtp_{n_f}
\end{equation*}
where $\delta \q_j \eqdef \frac \a \h \p_j - \q_j$ in the lattice reference frame.

In particular, if $\left| H'_{f + (\delta \q_j),i} \right|^2$ admits such a continuation and if $i$ and $f$ could be approximated by plane wave states, the leading order transition probability could be approximated, for $i \notin \delta \F$, by:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\TPn i {\delta \F} 2 & \approx & \int_{\prod_j \delta P_j} ( 2 \pi )^2 \frac{t - t_0} \h \left| H'_{f + (\delta \q_j),i} \right|^2 \deltaE2{E_{f + (\delta \q_j)} - E_i} \\
&& \left( (1 + 2 \N) \frac \a \h \right)^{3 n_f} \dtp_1 \dotsm \dtp_{n_f}
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Quantum measurement}
\label{Quantum measurement}

Let us consider a simple thought experiment in order to illustrate how measurement processes take place: An excited atom decays by emitting a photon, which is detected by a photomultiplier read by an observer. In the initial state, at time $t_0$, the atom has just been switched to its excited state and hasn't decayed yet, the measurement apparatus is indicating that it hasn't yet detected any photon and the observer is waiting for the detector to get activated. We symbolize this situation by:
\begin{flushleft}
\ExcitedAtom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\end{flushleft}
The decay of the excited atom into a stable atom and a photon (via the QED processes described in chapter \ref{Quantum Electrodynamics}) first brings it into a quantum superposition of states, where both states coexist as a linear combination within the quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ of the universe. In both cases, the measurement apparatus is still inactive so far and the observer waiting. We symbolize this situation by:
\begin{flushleft}
\ExcitedAtom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\Photon\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\end{flushleft}
Supposing, to simplify, that the photomultiplier has a detection efficiency of 100\%, it gets activated with certainty by the incoming photon after a certain delay $\Delta t$, coming thus itself into a quantum superposition of states. At the same time, the excited atom populates again the decayed atom state, as in the preceding step. In all three cases, the observer is still waiting that far. We symbolize this situation by:
\begin{flushleft}
\ExcitedAtom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\Photon\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOn\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\end{flushleft}
Finally, the observer is becoming aware of the fact that the detector has been activated and comes herself into a quantum superposition of states, so that four qualitatively different states coexist as a linear combination within the quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ of the universe. We symbolize this situation by:
\begin{flushleft}
\ExcitedAtom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\Photon\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOn\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOn\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOn
\end{flushleft}
This (purely material) situation lasts until the next process of collapse and collective mind selection takes place. The experienced consciousness state of the observer is then, randomly, either one of ``I am still waiting for the detector to get activated'' or ``I have seen the detector becoming activated''. In the first case, the quantum state of the universe becomes again:
\begin{flushleft}
\ExcitedAtom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\Photon\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOff\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\hspace*{3mm}\Superposition\hspace*{3mm}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOn\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOff
\end{flushleft}
i.e. the detector has still been activated, but the observer didn't yet notice it. In the second case, the state of the universe becomes:
\begin{flushleft}
\Atom\hspace*{3mm}\DetectorOn\hspace*{3mm}\ObserverOn
\end{flushleft}
and the atom has definitely decayed. The probability $\delta P$ of this event to occur is very small, but the process of collapse and collective mind selection take place very often, with a period $\tau$, so that the decay of the atom should eventually be observed. The leading order approximation of this elementary probability takes the form:
\begin{equation*}
\delta P \approx ( 2 \pi )^2 \frac\tau\h \sum_f \left| H'_{f,i} \right|^2 \deltaE2{E_f - E_i}
\end{equation*}
where the Coulomb interaction term is supposed to have been shifted into the zeroth order Hamiltonian operator $\Hop_0$, where the summation runs over an orthonormal basis of eigenstates of this operator and where the delta function can be approximated by the (time independent) density of decay states (with regard to energy) around the ``allowed'' decay states conserving zeroth order energy. The duration until the decay is being observed follows a Poisson law and its mean value is given by the general formula:
\begin{equation*}
\left< t - t_0 \right> \approx \Delta t + \tau \frac{1 - \delta P}{\delta P}
\end{equation*}
It can be approximated in this case, since $\delta P \ll 1$, by:
\begin{equation*}
\left< t - t_0 \right> \approx \Delta t + \h \Big[ ( 2 \pi )^2 \sum_f \left| H'_{f,i} \right|^2 \deltaE2{E_f - E_i} \Big]^{-1}
\end{equation*}
Note that this result doesn't depend on the period $\tau$ of the collapse and collective mind selection process.
